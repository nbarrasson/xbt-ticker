# xbt-ticker

A simple Bitcoin/USD exchange rate ticker in React using WebSocket API from [Kraken](https://docs.kraken.com/websockets/) exposed through Azure API Management.

Packages used :

* [isomorphic-ws](https://github.com/heineiuo/isomorphic-ws#readme) for handling WS connection
* [recharts](https://recharts.org/) for charts generation

The purpose of this sample is to demo Azure API Management new WebSocket support.
